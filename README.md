# Advanced Employee Analysis SQL Project

## Description

This project contains a series of advanced SQL queries designed to analyze a comprehensive employee dataset. The analysis aims to derive actionable insights to improve organizational performance and employee satisfaction.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase advanced SQL skills, including the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, CASE statements, and subqueries, in performing complex data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset Information

The analysis is based on three datasets:

General Employee Data: Contains demographic information, job roles, tenure, and attrition status.

Employee Survey Data: Provides insights into employee satisfaction levels across various aspects such as job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and work-life balance.

Manager Survey Data: Includes performance ratings and job involvement levels as assessed by managers.

## Queries Included
Average Satisfaction Scores by Department: Calculates the average satisfaction score per employee and compares it to the department average using CTE and window functions.

Employee Experience Levels: Categorizes employees into different experience levels based on their years at the company using a CASE statement.

Top Performers in Each Department: Identifies top performers in each department using subqueries.

Attrition Risk Ranking: Ranks employees by attrition risk within each department using CTE and window functions.

Average Training Times by Tenure: Calculates average training times attended by employees in different tenure categories within each department using CTE and aggregation.

High Job Involvement and Performance Ratings: Identifies employees with the highest levels of job involvement and performance ratings.

Average Age by Gender and Department: Calculates the average age of employees by gender and department.

Average Distance from Home by Business Travel Frequency: Determines the average distance from home for employees based on their business travel frequency using CTE.
